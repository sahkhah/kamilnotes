/* Transforms each element of this stream into a new stream event.

Creates a new stream that converts each element of this stream to a new value using the [convert] function, 
and emits the result.

For each data event, o, in this stream, the returned stream provides a data event with the value convert(o). 
If [convert] throws, the returned stream reports it as an error event instead.

Error and done events are passed through unchanged to the returned stream.

The returned stream is a broadcast stream if this stream is. The [convert] function is called once per data event 
per listener. If a broadcast stream is listened to more than once, each subscription will individually call [convert] on each data event.

Unlike [transform], this method does not treat the stream as chunks of a single value. Instead each event is converted 
independently of the previous and following events, which may not always be correct. For example, UTF-8 encoding, or decoding, will give wrong results if a surrogate pair, or a multibyte UTF-8 encoding, is split into separate events, and those events are attempted encoded or decoded independently.

Example:

final stream =
    Stream<int>.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => count)
        .take(5);

final calculationStream =
    stream.map<String>((event) => 'Square: ${event * event}');
calculationStream.forEach(print);
// Square: 0
// Square: 1
// Square: 4
// Square: 9
// Square: 16
